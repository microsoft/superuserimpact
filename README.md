<summary><strong>📊 Why Study Super Usage & Insights You Can Explore</strong></summary>

<br>

Super usage patterns show how experimentation turns into durable habits. Identifying early signals and contextual attributes helps you:
- Replicate adoption paths
- Prioritize enablement
- Benchmark across teams
- Inspire the organization

**Super usage profile:**
What does super usage look like? What do super users use Copilot for? Are you seeing signs of workflow changes?

**Journey:**
How did some users turn into super users? What did super users do differently in the early days of license activation? How fast are you producing super users? Is super usage durable?

**Work patterns:**
What work patterns are associated with super users? Are you seeing any early impact?

**Change management:**
Where are the super users concentrated? Where might you focus enablement efforts?
